# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`<workflow-root>/context/CONTEXT.md`**, or
- **`<workflow-root>/context/CONTEXT-MAP.md`** if it exists; it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`<workflow-root>/adr/`**; read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. In multi-context repos, also check `<workflow-root>/adr/<context>/` for context-scoped decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo (most repos):

```
<workflow-root>/
├── context/
│   └── CONTEXT.md
└── adr/
    ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
    └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
```

Multi-context repo (presence of `<workflow-root>/context/CONTEXT-MAP.md`):

```
/
├── <workflow-root>/
│   ├── context/
│   │   └── CONTEXT-MAP.md             ← points at the per-context files below
│   └── adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
└── src/
    ├── ordering/
    │   ├── CONTEXT.md                 ← per-context: stays with its code
    └── billing/
        ├── CONTEXT.md
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal; either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/grill-with-docs`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders); but worth reopening because…_

For multiple contexts, store new context-specific ADRs under <workflow-root>/adr/<context>/ and record those locations in the context map. Existing project domain.md locations take precedence; preserve established source-adjacent context documents.
